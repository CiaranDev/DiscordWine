I'm not trying to make the code fancy or anything so w/e.
Just a basic colour editor with a watermark and some other little things, nothing huge might add some fancier features in the future. Probably got a tonne of bugs but I'm busy with college.

Installation: Just drag and drop into AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes then activate it in the settings panel.
